I appeal to the developers who still have warm feelings for C++ (even if you left the field):

*Please, raise discussions about improving something **outside** of the language itself.* You might've worked in Elixir / Rust / Node / whatever ecosystem. Maybe you saw a great book, tool, approach, or something else that can be transferred to the C++ ecosystem.

Stop worrying about syntax so much and start raising questions like:
- Why don't we have an easy introduction book like Rust has? Can we make one? Can I make it?
- Can we try to learn from Rust and build a community by becoming attractive to people from other domains? What are those domains?
- Can we make implementing CLI applications convenient? Who would like to create convenient tools/libraries for this task? Why does nobody want to do it?
- Elixir used Erlang to accelerate itself but it also helped accelerate the Erlang ecosystem. Is it possible for us to do something similar?
- Why don't we have NPM packages in C++? Can we come up with a better alternative? Can we help Conan somehow?
- How can we improve tools for programming games with C++? Is it possible for us to overcome issues [Jai](https://inductive.no/jai/) tries to solve without leaving C++ behind?
- Do we even need to pursue thing "X" or is it better to make a clear statement that C++ is not suited for domain X? How do we communicate this information to the newcomers and existing developers?
- When we hold a conference, do we mention the tools our community built? Do we help them succeed?
- Should we have some kind of accessibility/approachability committee?
- Why everything around C++ feels so old? Why our learning resources are so ugly?
- Why don't we have Primagen, Theo, or similar youtubers actively promoting C++?
- Why are there people who don't feel valued in the C++ ecosystem despite making tremendous efforts?
- etc.etc.etc.


Here we go, let me raise one more relatively simple question myself:
- When I type "learn C++" in google, why do I get results from w3schools, codecademy, and learncpp.com, but not from an official website that helps me choose the best learning resource specifically for me?

Do you think it would be OK to approach the committee and ask if I can create an official "entry portal" for C++? Do we need this? Should I approach them with a different idea?

**Will anybody listen to me or I'll waste 10 years of my life "writing papers and arguing my case to more people"**?

Maybe I'm young and naive, but I fail to understand why we care so much about our static library APIs yet ignore the "human" API we expose to the community. Do we want C++ to become a "corporate-only" industry?

Thank you for your time. Hopefully, I managed to make your eyes sparkle a bit.
